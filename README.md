# Global Tech University Admissions Optimizer

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This project builds a decision-support tool to assist Global Tech University (GTU) with international graduate admissions. The model is trained on five years of applicant data to:

- Predict admission probability
- Inform scholarship decisions
- Reduce faculty review burden

## ðŸ’¡ Business Questions Solved

- How do academic variables like GRE and CGPA influence admit chances?
- Can subjective features (SOP, LOR) and research background improve prediction?
- How many merit scholarships can be awarded within budget?

## ðŸ§ª Models Used

- Multiple Linear Regression (Baseline)
- Decision Tree Regressor (Policy Interpretation)
- Random Forest Regressor (Accurate Ranking)

## âœ… Final Enhancements

- Hyperparameter tuning for Random Forest and Decision Tree
- Feature importanceâ€“based modeling (top 5)
- Multicollinearity detection and handling using VIF

## ðŸ“Š Results Summary
